[Intro]
<br>
Ah-ah-ah-ah
<br>
Paper flowers
<br>
Ah-ah-ah-ah
<br>
Paper flowers
<br>
[Verse 1]
<br>
I linger in the doorway<br>
Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name<br>
Let me stay where the wind will whisper to me<br>
Where the raindrops, as theyâ€™re falling, tell a story
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
In my field of paper flowers (Ah-ah-ah-ah)<br>
And candy clouds of lullaby (Paper flowers)<br>
I lie inside myself for hours (Ah-ah-ah-ah)<br>
And watch my purple sky fly over me (Paper flowers)<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
Don't say I'm out of touch<br>
With this rampant chaos, your reality<br>
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge<br>
The nightmare I built my own world to escape<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
In my field of paper flowers (Ah-ah-ah-ah)<br>
And candy clouds of lullaby (Paper flowers)<br>
I lie inside myself for hours (Ah-ah-ah-ah)<br>
And watch my purple sky fly over me (Paper flowers)<br>
<br>
[Instrumental Break]
<br>
[Bridge]
<br>
Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming<br>
Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights<br>
Oh, how I long for the deep sleep dreaming<br>
The goddess of Imaginary light<br>
<br>
[Guitar Solo]
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
In my field of paper flowers (Ah-ah-ah-ah)<br>
And candy clouds of lullaby (Paper flowers)<br>
I lie inside myself for hours (Ah-ah-ah-ah)<br>
And watch my purple sky fly over me (Paper flowers)<br>
<br>
[Outro]
<br>
Ah-ah-ah-ah<br>
Paper flowers<br>
Ah-ah-ah-ah<br>
Paper flowers<br>
